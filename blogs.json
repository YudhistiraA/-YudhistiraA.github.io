So Figma\u2019s Auto Layout feature is a powerful tool that makes designing interfaces faster and easier than ever before. Essentially, it allows you to create dynamic components that automatically adjust their size and layout based on their\u00a0content.</p>\n<p>So, let\u2019s say you have a button component that you want to use in multiple places throughout your design. With Auto Layout, you can set it up so that the button will automatically resize itself based on the length of the text inside it. This means that you don\u2019t have to manually adjust the size and position of the button every time you use it in a different context\u200a\u2014\u200aFigma does the work for you! Curious about how to use it? let\u2019s just start the tutorial.</p>\n<h4>Step 1\u200a\u2014\u200aCreating a\u00a0frame</h4>\n<p>When the first time opening the Figma file, you will always see this blank page. And of course, you need a frame to start everything.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*DTKhjqWf8_ajTKuq2x2vkg.png\"><figcaption>Figma blank\u00a0page</figcaption></figure><p>To create a frame you can click this tool right here or just press F on your keyboard.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/255/1*bZ2hBeAeozN_1KTKT9u72w.png\"><figcaption>Frame tool</figcaption></figure><p>When you\u2019ve selected the frame tool, you will see on the right sidebar that Figma already has options for the frame size that you can\u00a0choose.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/240/1*QjDvCisnEyoHNFza8B8TJw.png\"><figcaption>Frame size</figcaption></figure><p>Now we have a frame on our page, and we can start from now\u00a0on.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*yE_O9_Ln60KezmOMbOwKFA.png\"><figcaption>Blank frame</figcaption></figure><h4>Step 2\u200a\u2014\u200aCreating a basic\u00a0button</h4>\n<p>When creating a button we need various attributes such as color, text, shape, size, etc. With Figma\u2019s Auto Layout feature, you can take your button design to the next level. Now to get started, simply select the text tool or just press T on your keyboard and type the text you want to put in on your\u00a0button.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*JmYC_ialnwx6hruU3TTOFQ.png\"></figure><p>Now there are two ways of implementing auto layout on your text. The first way is transforming your text to a frame by pressing right-click and select <em>frame selection. </em>In the right sidebar, click the + button next to Auto Layout with a frame selected. And the second way which is the easiest way I always use is using a shortcut by pressing shift + A on your keyboard.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/241/1*2vj2881OThIuLtz-J73evQ.png\"><figcaption>auto layout\u00a0panel</figcaption></figure><p>If it\u2019s done right, you will see this auto layout panel on the right sidebar. And now you\u2019ve implemented auto layout on your text.

While the concept is exciting, I have noted that early access games often have a less-than-ideal user interface (UI) design. In this article, we\u2019ll explore some of the reasons why this may be the\u00a0case.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"SCUM gameplay\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*N0kbcYCxnEF37YgP.jpg\"><figcaption>UI design of SCUM by Croatian studio Gamepires</figcaption></figure><h3>What are early-access games?</h3>\n<p>Early access games, also known as alpha or beta access games, are a type of video game development model that has gained popularity in recent years. In this model, developers release a playable version of their game to the public before it is fully completed, allowing players to experience the game and provide feedback to the developers. This feedback can be used to improve the game\u2019s mechanics, features, and overall gameplay experience.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*kjV3gi_oCEk8CHURbT9-Ug.png\"><figcaption>Early-access games section on Steam\u00a0store</figcaption></figure><p>Early access games are typically available for purchase on digital distribution platforms, such as Steam or Epic Games Store, and players can participate in the development process by providing feedback, reporting bugs, and suggesting improvements. This can be beneficial for both the developers and the players, as it can lead to a more engaging and polished final\u00a0product.</p>\n<p>By listening to feedback and implementing changes based on player input, developers can create a game that is tailored to the desires of their audience. This model allows developers to involve the community in the game\u2019s development and make changes based on player feedback, with the ultimate goal of creating a better final\u00a0product.</p>\n<p>Despite the many benefits of early-access games, one common issue that players often encounter is a less-than-ideal user interface (UI). The UI encompasses the visual and interactive elements of a game that players use to navigate menus, access options, and interact with the game\u00a0world.</p>\n<p>There are several reasons why early access games may have bad UI. One reason is that developers may prioritize other aspects of the game during development and I\u2019ve tried to describe some of the aspects that I think are the main\u00a0factors.</p>\n<h3>What makes early-access games have a bad user interface?</h3>\n<h4>1. Development Priorities</h4>\n<p>If you\u2019ve ever played an early access game, you\u2019ll know that they\u2019re typically still in development. This means that developers are constantly adding new features and making changes to the content. While this can be exciting for players who want to experience something new and fresh, it can also mean that the game may have bugs or unfinished content.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*o2QvJbuDmWpSQboC.gif\"></figure><p>One thing to keep in mind is that developers may prioritize adding new gameplay mechanics or content over improving the UI. This is because they want to keep players engaged and interested in the game. However, this can lead to a less polished user experience. It\u2019s important to be patient and understand that the game is still a work in progress.</p>\n<h4>2. Limited resources</h4>\n<p>The rise of early-access games in recent years has been accompanied by an increase in the number of small indie studios developing games with limited resources. These studios may not have the budget to hire a dedicated user interface (UI) designer and instead rely on their existing team members to handle UI\u00a0design.</p>\n<p>In larger studios, UI designers work closely with other team members to ensure that the UI is intuitive, aesthetically pleasing, and optimized for different platforms and devices. In contrast, smaller studios may not have the same level of expertise or resources when it comes to UI\u00a0design.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*WgYnQaZyxLDvZekR.png\"><figcaption>Subsurface Circular (Bithell\u00a0Games)</figcaption></figure><p>As Alexander Sliwinski, COO of Bithell Games, points out, it\u2019s not uncommon for newly established development duos to consist of one coder, one designer, and/or one artist. While this approach can certainly work for some studios, it can result in a less polished UI compared to games developed by larger studios with dedicated UI teams. That\u2019s not to say that smaller studios can\u2019t produce great UI, it just means that they face additional challenges and may need to get creative with their approach.</p>\n<h4>3. Lack of user\u00a0feedback</h4>\n<p>When Early Access games are released, their UI designs may be incomplete or imperfect. This is because developers are still working on iterating and refining the game, and they may not have had the chance to get feedback from users yet. Without user feedback, developers may not know which aspects of the UI need improvement, and they may not have the resources to conduct extensive user\u00a0testing.</p>\n<p>As a result, UI design may not receive as much attention as other aspects of the game during the Early Access phase. However, this is where you, the player, come in! By providing feedback on the UI design, you can help the developers create a more polished and user-friendly game.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/828/0*ZwGj6_zmJysxVIwb\"></figure><p>To address these challenges, it is essential for developers to prioritize UI design and gather feedback from users during the early access phase. This can involve conducting user testing, gathering feedback through forums or social media, and iteratively improving the UI design based on this feedback. By doing so, developers can ensure that the UI is intuitive, visually appealing, and enhances the overall gaming experience.</p>\n<h4>4. Rapid prototyping</h4>\n<p>As you may know, rapid prototyping is a crucial process that allows developers to test out new gameplay mechanics and ideas quickly, before investing too much time and resources into them. By rapidly prototyping new concepts, developers can get a better sense of what works and what doesn\u2019t, and make adjustments accordingly.</p>\n<p>During this early stage of development, UI design may not always be the top priority for developers. With so much focus on testing out new ideas, it can be easy for UI design to become an afterthought. As a result, the UI of early access games may not be as polished or refined as it could\u00a0be.</p>\n<p>While UI design may not seem like a high priority during the early stages of development, it can have a significant impact on the overall user experience. It is essential to consider UI design during the initial stages to ensure that it aligns with the game\u2019s vision and gameplay mechanics. Neglecting UI design during the early stages can result in a suboptimal user experience, leading to players losing interest in the\u00a0game.</p>\n<p>Developers often refine the UI design during the later stages of development, once the gameplay mechanics have been established. However, this approach can result in additional development time and resources spent on fixing and redesigning UI elements that could have been addressed earlier. Therefore, it is crucial to incorporate UI design in the early stages of development to ensure that it is integrated seamlessly with the gameplay mechanics.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>In conclusion, the UI design of early access games may be less polished due to development priorities, lack of user feedback, and rapid prototyping. While this may be frustrating for players, it\u2019s important to remember that early access games are still in development, and UI design may improve as the game progresses. Providing constructive feedback to developers can also help improve the UI and overall gameplay experience. Additionally, developers may prioritize UI design in later stages of development, once gameplay mechanics have been established. Overall, the early access model provides an exciting opportunity for players to help shape the development of games and can lead to better games in the long\u00a0run.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading my article!

While the concept is exciting, I have noted that early access games often have a less-than-ideal user interface (UI) design. In this article, we\u2019ll explore some of the reasons why this may be the\u00a0case.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"SCUM gameplay\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*N0kbcYCxnEF37YgP.jpg\"><figcaption>UI design of SCUM by Croatian studio Gamepires</figcaption></figure><h3>What are early-access games?</h3>\n<p>Early access games, also known as alpha or beta access games, are a type of video game development model that has gained popularity in recent years. In this model, developers release a playable version of their game to the public before it is fully completed, allowing players to experience the game and provide feedback to the developers. This feedback can be used to improve the game\u2019s mechanics, features, and overall gameplay experience.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*kjV3gi_oCEk8CHURbT9-Ug.png\"><figcaption>Early-access games section on Steam\u00a0store</figcaption></figure><p>Early access games are typically available for purchase on digital distribution platforms, such as Steam or Epic Games Store, and players can participate in the development process by providing feedback, reporting bugs, and suggesting improvements. This can be beneficial for both the developers and the players, as it can lead to a more engaging and polished final\u00a0product.</p>\n<p>By listening to feedback and implementing changes based on player input, developers can create a game that is tailored to the desires of their audience. This model allows developers to involve the community in the game\u2019s development and make changes based on player feedback, with the ultimate goal of creating a better final\u00a0product.</p>\n<p>Despite the many benefits of early-access games, one common issue that players often encounter is a less-than-ideal user interface (UI). The UI encompasses the visual and interactive elements of a game that players use to navigate menus, access options, and interact with the game\u00a0world.</p>\n<p>There are several reasons why early access games may have bad UI. One reason is that developers may prioritize other aspects of the game during development and I\u2019ve tried to describe some of the aspects that I think are the main\u00a0factors.</p>\n<h3>What makes early-access games have a bad user interface?</h3>\n<h4>1. Development Priorities</h4>\n<p>If you\u2019ve ever played an early access game, you\u2019ll know that they\u2019re typically still in development. This means that developers are constantly adding new features and making changes to the content. While this can be exciting for players who want to experience something new and fresh, it can also mean that the game may have bugs or unfinished content.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*o2QvJbuDmWpSQboC.gif\"></figure><p>One thing to keep in mind is that developers may prioritize adding new gameplay mechanics or content over improving the UI. This is because they want to keep players engaged and interested in the game. However, this can lead to a less polished user experience. It\u2019s important to be patient and understand that the game is still a work in progress.</p>\n<h4>2. Limited resources</h4>\n<p>The rise of early-access games in recent years has been accompanied by an increase in the number of small indie studios developing games with limited resources. These studios may not have the budget to hire a dedicated user interface (UI) designer and instead rely on their existing team members to handle UI\u00a0design.</p>\n<p>In larger studios, UI designers work closely with other team members to ensure that the UI is intuitive, aesthetically pleasing, and optimized for different platforms and devices. In contrast, smaller studios may not have the same level of expertise or resources when it comes to UI\u00a0design.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*WgYnQaZyxLDvZekR.png\"><figcaption>Subsurface Circular (Bithell\u00a0Games)</figcaption></figure><p>As Alexander Sliwinski, COO of Bithell Games, points out, it\u2019s not uncommon for newly established development duos to consist of one coder, one designer, and/or one artist. While this approach can certainly work for some studios, it can result in a less polished UI compared to games developed by larger studios with dedicated UI teams. That\u2019s not to say that smaller studios can\u2019t produce great UI, it just means that they face additional challenges and may need to get creative with their approach.</p>\n<h4>3. Lack of user\u00a0feedback</h4>\n<p>When Early Access games are released, their UI designs may be incomplete or imperfect. This is because developers are still working on iterating and refining the game, and they may not have had the chance to get feedback from users yet.

But a while ago I\u2019m trying to find a website that needs a redesign and then I remember a friend of mine has told me that one of a framework\u2019s websites is really crappy in the aspect of visuals. It\u2019s called Ruby on Rails, then I checked the website and I just agreed with what my friend said. I\u2019m not saying the current website is bad but from my perspective, It\u2019s just really outdated. So I choose this website to redesign.</p>\n<h4>My goals and motivation for this\u00a0redesign</h4>\n<p>As I said before, when I see the website I see something off with the interface. So I want to deliver <strong>a new personalized experience and intuitive user interface</strong>. With this new design, I want to bring user perception to think that this framework is up to date also easy, and fun to\u00a0use.</p>\n<p>For my personal goals, I want this project can enhance my visual and decision-making skills.</p>\n<h4>Why do we need a redesign?</h4>\n<p>Redesign has so many meanings and uses. Most of the companies choose to redesign their website because after they did research they think their users feel like the website didn\u2019t provide what the users need or maybe the users said that the website\u2019s visual design is just a pain in the eyes. In this case, I just want to modernize Ruby on Rails\u2019 outdated website. Modernizing a website is just like restoring an old painting.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*OOGGwzmTweDGmrdI.jpg\"></figure><p>The idea of restoring a painting is to make it look more clean and neat so that it can be more enjoyed without wasting any essential essence. This concept is what I use to redesign the Ruby on Rails\u00a0website.</p>\n<h3>My redesign\u00a0process</h3>\n<p>Every designer has their own design process and neither do I. And my design process is not always the same each time I design a project but that doesn\u2019t mean it has no\u00a0rules.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*TwPMR7RVLewZjzGpw2tAug.png\"></figure><h4>Website analysis</h4>\n<p>To better understand the website, I need to construct the element structure and define the problem. That\u2019s the only way to find problems on a website because a disorganized structure can confuse users to get information about the website. There are five core elements that a good landing page must have. Which is a unique selling proposition, a headline which shows the core of the whole website, the benefits provided by the website, some social proof for credibility, and lastly a single conversion goal.</p>\n<p>The anatomy of this website is actually pretty simple, it only consists of 5 main sections which almost meet the five core elements\u00a0above.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the navigation;</li>\n<li>the headline;</li>\n<li>the introduction;</li>\n<li>the must-know information;</li>\n<li>the footer.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After identifying and analyzing the structure I realized it missing something, so I interviewed some people to ask a question related to this website. It helped me to understand what can I do to improve the website. My interview with 10 users leads to several insights that I think can be a problem to the\u00a0website:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Users being confused with the navigation</li>\n<li>Some users having trouble finding the download\u00a0button</li>\n<li>Users think that the visual is\u00a0outdated</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These insights can lead me to move furthermore to the next step of redesign, solutions.</p>\n<h3>Solutions</h3>\n<p>This is the consequential part of redesigning a website where you need to explore your domain to think of several solutions for each identified pain point. During the ideation process, I can think of many design solutions but on the other side, I also need to keep the previous essential design to stay\u00a0intact.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/0*20J79ust03vib8Py\"><figcaption>source: <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/zoCDWPuiRuA\">https://unsplash.com/photos/zoCDWPuiRuA</a></figcaption></figure><h4>Hero Section</h4>\n<p>First thing first, we need to start from the first component of the website, which is the navigation bar. The navigation menu is the user\u2019s control station. It\u2019s their main point of contact when it comes to navigating a website, so it needs to be compact but still informative at the same time. To address the first pain points I just made minor changes. The first thing I do is analyze each element inside the navigation bar and determine is it necessary or not to put it on the navigation bar.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*emmBLx3kqHXQxhS85DuJ5g.png\"><figcaption>Wireframe for hero\u00a0section</figcaption></figure><p>As you can see, there\u2019s a lot of things that changed in the hero section. The first pain point is the navigation bar. In the current design, each nav links have a bottom border. As you know they designed it that way because they want to show the user that it\u2019s a link, which is really not necessary because it\u2019s obvious that a navigation bar is consists of a few information links. So I removed the bottom border and prioritize which one is need to be seen first, and it\u2019s the guide link. Because that\u2019s the most important information than the others, users tend to visit the website either download the product or learn the guideline.</p>\n<p>I also changed the headline to show the product more clear, and in some way emphasize the sentence <em>easier</em> and <em>more fun. </em>UX writing taught me that writing also can draw the attention of\u00a0users.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/978/1*yRG45mg1zsIVXcrcbLukng.jpeg\"></figure><p>And the third thing I changed is the illustration. The illustration also plays a serious role in a hero section. It draws the attention of the users and can be the face of the whole website. As I mentioned before, the illustration from the current design is outdated so I changed it. I choose an illustration that can explain the headline of the website and is also consistent with the overall design. You didn\u2019t have to make an illustration by yourself, there are plenty of free illustrations out there. For example, I download this awesome illustration from <a href=\"https://iconscout.com/contributors/iconscout\">iconscout</a>.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*1CvaQshtYEUHZiTMhWcKPg.png\"></figure><p>Another thing to mention is, Ruby on Rails tried to tell the user that their product is used by many huge applications. It\u2019s good because it shows how trustworthy they are. But the thing is, their placement is a bit off. They waste so much space with copywriting that unnecessary. So I simplified it by putting the company logo in the hero section, so the user can see it right away and didn\u2019t have to read many\u00a0words.</p>\n<h4>Discovery Section</h4>\n<p>In the discovery section, they put such as tutorial for configuration. It\u2019s good placement but the thing is it took so much space and less white space. So the design is hard to breathe. So I improvise with the layout design, I put an example of ruby on rails usage and a button that linked to a youtube video of the configuration.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*wuUEve6-LewPVHv_I3vRCQ.png\"></figure><p>Under the configuration video, I designed a simple and fun layout for the introduction of the framework. This section will convince the user to download the product. They actually make a page about this information, but I want to put it on the landing page because I think it\u2019s important information for some new users and it shows how trustworthy and useful is their\u00a0product.</p>\n<h4>Footer Section</h4>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*33R_FZJuT0mkuz9vCfqoDQ.png\"></figure><p>Last but not least, the footer section. A section located on the bottom of the web pages that a lot of designers didn\u2019t pay attention to. However you should pay attention when designing a footer because it can greatly enhance a user\u2019s experience, the footer still receives a lot amount of use. I put some important elements on the footer that are important as the top of the page, such\u00a0as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Brand of the\u00a0company</li>\n<li>Utility links</li>\n<li>Secondary-task links</li>\n<li>Social engagement</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We don\u2019t need a complex layout for a footer. Most of the websites out there used the same layout as mine because the footer is like a recap for the whole pages of a website. So it needs to be simple but informative.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*MxnBidi7MPV5u4rEDbkyCQ.jpeg\"></figure><p>I learn a lot during making this case study. Creating solutions and solving users\u2019 problems is a fun way to make me a better designer. I want to remind you that this case study is not 100% perfect. I\u2019m a learner myself, that\u2019s why it\u2019s called a \u201ccase study\u201d isn\u2019t it?

As I mentioned before, the illustration from the current design is outdated so I changed it. I choose an illustration that can explain the headline of the website and is also consistent with the overall design. You didn\u2019t have to make an illustration by yourself, there are plenty of free illustrations out there. For example, I download this awesome illustration from <a href=\"https://iconscout.com/contributors/iconscout\">iconscout</a>.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*1CvaQshtYEUHZiTMhWcKPg.png\"></figure><p>Another thing to mention is, Ruby on Rails tried to tell the user that their product is used by many huge applications. It\u2019s good because it shows how trustworthy they are. But the thing is, their placement is a bit off. They waste so much space with copywriting that unnecessary. So I simplified it by putting the company logo in the hero section, so the user can see it right away and didn\u2019t have to read many\u00a0words.</p>\n<h4>Discovery Section</h4>\n<p>In the discovery section, they put such as tutorial for configuration. It\u2019s good placement but the thing is it took so much space and less white space. So the design is hard to breathe. So I improvise with the layout design, I put an example of ruby on rails usage and a button that linked to a youtube video of the configuration.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*wuUEve6-LewPVHv_I3vRCQ.png\"></figure><p>Under the configuration video, I designed a simple and fun layout for the introduction of the framework. This section will convince the user to download the product. They actually make a page about this information, but I want to put it on the landing page because I think it\u2019s important information for some new users and it shows how trustworthy and useful is their\u00a0product.</p>\n<h4>Footer Section</h4>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*33R_FZJuT0mkuz9vCfqoDQ.png\"></figure><p>Last but not least, the footer section. A section located on the bottom of the web pages that a lot of designers didn\u2019t pay attention to. However you should pay attention when designing a footer because it can greatly enhance a user\u2019s experience, the footer still receives a lot amount of use. I put some important elements on the footer that are important as the top of the page, such\u00a0as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Brand of the\u00a0company</li>\n<li>Utility links</li>\n<li>Secondary-task links</li>\n<li>Social engagement</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We don\u2019t need a complex layout for a footer. Most of the websites out there used the same layout as mine because the footer is like a recap for the whole pages of a website. So it needs to be simple but informative.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*MxnBidi7MPV5u4rEDbkyCQ.jpeg\"></figure><p>I learn a lot during making this case study. Creating solutions and solving users\u2019 problems is a fun way to make me a better designer. I want to remind you that this case study is not 100% perfect. I\u2019m a learner myself, that\u2019s why it\u2019s called a \u201ccase study\u201d isn\u2019t it?

You can see this type of style everywhere like in <a href=\"https://dribbble.com/\">Dribbble</a>, <a href=\"https://www.behance.net/\">Behance</a>, or even <a href=\"https://medium.com/topic/design\">Medium</a>. People really like this style because it helps the user to stay comfortable in the platform but at the same time, the design doesn\u2019t make the user get\u00a0bored.</p>\n<h4>Only user Interface</h4>\n<p>Before we get started, I want to tell you that in this article I will only show you step by step to make the UI design from wireframe to the final design. So there will be <strong>NO CODE </strong>or such\u00a0thing.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*rgbSz1x3HjM9y_Uc3REafA.jpeg\"></figure><h4>Sketch</h4>\n<p>So I have made a rough<em> </em>sketch for the login section in <a href=\"https://balsamiq.com/\">Balsamiq</a> that we will make it on a high fidelity wireframe later. You might be thinking \u201c<em>Why is it looks bad and ugly?\u201d </em>I know, that\u2019s why we call it <strong>rough</strong>. It\u2019s just a low visual representation of the section that shows the basic elements. Anyway, you also can make it just on\u00a0paper.</p>\n<h3>Figma basic\u00a0tutorial</h3>\n<h4>First thing\u00a0first</h4>\n<p>As you read on the title, I\u2019m using Figma to make the design. You might be asking why am I using Figma, you\u2019ll know it later. So before we get into the design you have to know the basic thing to use this tool. Figma is a free cloud-based design tool that really powerful. A lot of designers especially UI/UX Designers use this tool. All you have to do is just go to <a href=\"http://figma.com/\">figma.com</a> and make an account. After you make an account you can just make a new file. Then this is the first thing you\u2019ll see, this is our main workshop.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_FNC8WNT3r-llzTAC6WJ2w.jpeg\"></figure><h4>Tools</h4>\n<p>If you see closely there is a couple of tools in the top left of the window. There are move tools, region tools, shape tools, drawing tools, text, and comment. We will use them a lot later and I will tell you their function as this tutorial goes\u00a0by.</p>\n<h4>Wireframe</h4>\n<p>After you make the sketch surely you have to digitalize it and make it into a wireframe. So what is a wireframe?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<strong>Wireframe (n.)</strong><em><br>\u201cA basic visual guide used to suggest the layout of fundamental elements in a web interface.\u201d<br>(Source: </em><a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/wireframe\"><em>Wiktionary</em></a><em>)</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So how do you make the sketch into wireframe? Easy! I mean it\u2019s seriously easy. First, you have to make your frame. Frame is your platform size either it web or mobile, so basically it\u2019s like a canvas when you painting. To make a frame all you have to do is just clicking frame tools located beside move tools which is on the top left of the\u00a0window.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/387/1*0NY7JxH9JBKZIJBC4aoDSg.jpeg\"></figure><p>If you look at the right side there are a lot of frame choices. And it has a couple of options, such as Phone, Tablet, Desktop, Watch, Paper, and Social Media. And we will be using the Phone option, you can pick whichever size you want. But this time I\u2019ll be using iPhone SE\u00a0size.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/417/1*xWQPVCfW16kBFD9UI26fWg.jpeg\"></figure><p>And now it will be looking like this. The white rectangle in the center is your frame. You can change the name of the frame by double click it. I will change mine into \u201cWireframe\u201d.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*fKcn7i62aehJw8Y0Zy_NsQ.jpeg\"></figure><p>Before you make the wireframe, make sure you turn on the layout grid. It helps you to tidy up your content. You can turn it on by clicking your frame and look at the right panel. There\u2019s a section called \u201cLayout grid\u201d, so click the plus icon and now you have a\u00a0grid.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/585/1*7KJUyzZk8kl0eMG2lO_moQ.jpeg\"></figure><p>Now click the six little rectangles beside the grid. Now change the grid into columns. And make the column into 4 by changing the count. Change the type into stretch then change the margin into 37 and the gutter into 10. Now your frame will look like\u00a0this.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*TPIA0v_emlbACmqxu6hA7A.jpeg\"></figure><p>The pink shape in the frame is your helper. It helps you to organize your content. So make sure you put all your content\u00a0inside.</p>\n<p>Now all you have to do is make a wireframe look exactly like your sketch by using the shape tool and text. Just click the tool that you\u2019ll use and click it into your frame. And if you want to resize it just pull the side of the shape or you can change it manually on the right-side panel.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/378/1*qQrLsgeL_IJtK-Vf-9gpDQ.jpeg\"></figure><p>In my sketch, I put a text on the top as a greeting of the app. I named my app \u201cPlayIt\u201d. And I\u2019m using bold <em>Playfair Display</em> as my typeface, and the font size is 36. As I said before put all the content inside the\u00a0grid.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0YgbI88P-lofcEqNNPeSLQ.jpeg\"></figure><blockquote><strong>Little tips</strong></blockquote>\n<blockquote>Use a multiple of 8 or 4 for your margin. I\u2019m usually using multiple 8 for my design. You can check it by clicking the content and hold the alt key while directing your cursor to the other content or the frame. Or you can hold \u2325 if you\u2019re using\u00a0macOS.</blockquote>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/792/1*v7AgB_g_3nmDlLyID7hQ1g.jpeg\"><figcaption>I make the margin-top of my content to\u00a064</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*UWDGtaaQ9V2Yb00NhDmghA.jpeg\"><figcaption>I also make the top margin of the form content to the greeting content into 96. Which is also a multiple of\u00a08</figcaption></figure><p>Now let's say you have explored the tools and make your sketch into a wireframe. You can look at mine below, as you can see the wireframe is look-alike the sketch. And you should make yours look the same as your sketch\u00a0too.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ERKuSpXrsWtxWJ36XLqKTA.jpeg\"><figcaption>I\u2019ve made a textbox, button, and a little link to sign\u00a0up</figcaption></figure><p>That\u2019s it. You\u2019ve made a wireframe! Now let\u2019s move to the next step. It\u2019s time to finalize the design by putting color on other\u00a0stuff.</p>\n<h3>UI Design</h3>\n<h4>Color</h4>\n<p>Okay, so this is the interesting part and my favorite part of designing an interface. Putting color on all the components! \ud83c\udf89 If you want to achieve a clean design, you have to choose a soft or pastel color. You can find a lot of color palettes on the internet, or you can make it by\u00a0yourself</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/563/1*zFjnOPUnQosSMEOBW-_amg.jpeg\"><figcaption>Color palette I found on <a href=\"http://pinterest.com/\">Pinterest</a></figcaption></figure><p>But this is why I love using Figma, Figma really make our work a lot easier. We can install a lot of cool plugins on it. Such as color palette. Yes, they have color palettes plugin that makes our workflow so much easier and faster obviously. If you go back to your dashboard or drafts when all your files are stored, on the left panel you can see plugins. So if you want to install a plugin you can just click it and find a plugin that you want then press the install\u00a0button.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*gts7lvI-QJGlu3oVIx-ybw.jpeg\"><figcaption>This is the color palettes plugin that I installed on my\u00a0Figma</figcaption></figure><p>So how you used this plugin? Simple. Just go to your file where you make the wireframe earlier. And in the top corner left there\u2019s a menu that you can click. When you click it there\u2019s an option for plugins, and there\u2019s where your plugins\u00a0stored.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/594/1*rx8Rt4AREH7tn-X7ON7eRQ.jpeg\"><figcaption>There are several plugins that I\u2019ve installed</figcaption></figure><p>Using the color palettes plugin is just by clicking the plugin and a new window will open up. There\u2019s a lot of color plugin you can use, just click the color and you\u2019ve automatically copied the hex code of the\u00a0color.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*7tCthV4vLz0p7R6L__0hng.jpeg\"></figure><p>So let\u2019s say you\u2019ve chosen the color. Now click the component where you want to put a color on it. And look at the right side of the panel, there\u2019s an option called \u201cfill\u201d. Now click the fill and paste the hex code that you\u2019ve copied\u00a0earlier.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*v07vOW9TR6VvjscaSv2ucQ.jpeg\"></figure><p>In this design I want my greeting text to have two colors, the app name should have a different color to make a variation and to bold the app name. So how to do it? Just block the text that you want to change the color and same as before, click the fill and paste the hex code of the new\u00a0color.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*sUE92JCv4P3Wi6km0vpD9A.jpeg\"></figure><p>And I only put two color tones on this design just to make it more simple. It\u2019s dark green and light green. If you\u2019re curious the hex code is #59B791 for the dark green and #ABE4CD for the light green. For the form text and the button text, I also used different colors. I used light grey as my form text, the hex code is #8C8B98. And the button text is just white\u00a0color.</p>\n<blockquote><strong>Little tips</strong></blockquote>\n<blockquote>Use a darker color for the link than the other text, so the user will know that there\u2019s a link that can be click/pressed. Now it should look like\u00a0this.</blockquote>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Z0-hOY06nzaTi3pS04-RJQ.jpeg\"></figure><h4>Icon</h4>\n<p>It almost there! \ud83c\udf89 So, what do you think needs to be added? Right! there\u2019s two rectangle shapes besides the form text that we still don\u2019t know what to do with it. And now what do you think should we put there? Yup, some\u00a0icons!</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*nQLScynHWWqGev08\"><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@aquatium?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Harpal Singh</a> on\u00a0<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>There\u2019s a lot of ways to make an icon, you can make it by yourself and save it as svg format then put it to your frame or download it on the internet then put it to your frame again. We all agree it\u2019s kind of complicated right? But don\u2019t worry, as I said before Figma really makes our work a lot easier. We can use plugin again for the icon. There are a lot of icon plugins on Figma, but I installed the one called\u00a0Iconify.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*eJ1x1PU_VSYRMXpKR6i44Q.jpeg\"></figure><p>Now I\u2019ll show you how to use this plugin. Basically it\u2019s the same as the previous plugin. Just go to the place where your color palettes plugin stored. If you already installed iconify plugin, there will be shown on the option. And just click\u00a0it.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*WgWHfiESzSJQevv7uSDHWA.jpeg\"><figcaption>This is how the plugin looks\u00a0like</figcaption></figure><p>Now you can find any icon that you want. And if you want to make your design clean and simple, make sure you use the same icon style. Just take a look at the icons that I\u2019ve\u00a0picked.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*pFPGiwonA9cQNaW3rILfMg.jpeg\"><figcaption>I\u2019m using line style for all\u00a0icon</figcaption></figure><h4>Finishing</h4>\n<p>After all the layout is done, we need some improvements. As you can see the design is a little bit boring. So we have to add something. In this part you can use your imagination to make the design \u201cless quiet\u201d. So I\u2019ll try to make something with the shape\u00a0tool.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m trying to make geometric shapes by using the circle tool. So all you have to do is making a small circle around 5px. Then copy-pasted it until you think it\u2019s enough, and I\u2019m making it 9x9. And then use the same color as the form text, and group all the circle by pressing ctrl+g or command+g if you\u2019re using\u00a0macOS.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*75ElD2yCMXg2ceYn7jRwow.jpeg\"></figure><p>Now I want to make a curved line with the pen tool then copy-pasted it to make an abstract shape. You can find the pen tool the same as the other tool, it is right beside the shape tool. And to use it all you have to do is just click and hold until it\u00a0bent.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*s9_Y4kShgOpvkyevGc5kEA.jpeg\"></figure><p>Then change the stroke color the same as the form text color. You can change the stroke color in the right-side panel, it\u2019s in the same place as the fill option. And group all the line then put it wherever you think it fits. I put mine on the top left of the\u00a0frame.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*hVi4Z9gadAIUxASxaRi2TQ.jpeg\"><figcaption>Those are the shapes that we just\u00a0made</figcaption></figure><p>And now it\u2019s done!\u00a0\ud83c\udf89</p>\n<p>You can also explore it to make the Sign-Up section design. I hope this tutorial helps you to improve your design skill and I hope it motivated you to design gorgeous\u00a0UI/UX.</p>\n<blockquote>Happy designing and stay\u00a0curious!</blockquote>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*gx--cCqbRb0aaAImeDBHeA.jpeg\"></figure><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=cababa2ddaab\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.prototypr.io/how-i-make-a-clean-ui-design-for-login-section-with-figma-from-scratch-cababa2ddaab\">How I make a clean UI design for login section with Figma from scratch</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://blog.prototypr.io/\">Prototypr</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>\n","content":"\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*gx--cCqbRb0aaAImeDBHeA.jpeg\"><figcaption>This is the user interface that we will\u00a0make</figcaption></figure><h4>Why is it has to be clean and\u00a0simple?</h4>\n<p>This is one of several styles that is really on demand in the market right now.

There\u2019s a section called \u201cLayout grid\u201d, so click the plus icon and now you have a\u00a0grid.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/585/1*7KJUyzZk8kl0eMG2lO_moQ.jpeg\"></figure><p>Now click the six little rectangles beside the grid. Now change the grid into columns. And make the column into 4 by changing the count. Change the type into stretch then change the margin into 37 and the gutter into 10. Now your frame will look like\u00a0this.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*TPIA0v_emlbACmqxu6hA7A.jpeg\"></figure><p>The pink shape in the frame is your helper. It helps you to organize your content. So make sure you put all your content\u00a0inside.</p>\n<p>Now all you have to do is make a wireframe look exactly like your sketch by using the shape tool and text. Just click the tool that you\u2019ll use and click it into your frame. And if you want to resize it just pull the side of the shape or you can change it manually on the right-side panel.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/378/1*qQrLsgeL_IJtK-Vf-9gpDQ.jpeg\"></figure><p>In my sketch, I put a text on the top as a greeting of the app. I named my app \u201cPlayIt\u201d. And I\u2019m using bold <em>Playfair Display</em> as my typeface, and the font size is 36. As I said before put all the content inside the\u00a0grid.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0YgbI88P-lofcEqNNPeSLQ.jpeg\"></figure><blockquote><strong>Little tips</strong></blockquote>\n<blockquote>Use a multiple of 8 or 4 for your margin. I\u2019m usually using multiple 8 for my design. You can check it by clicking the content and hold the alt key while directing your cursor to the other content or the frame. Or you can hold \u2325 if you\u2019re using\u00a0macOS.</blockquote>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/792/1*v7AgB_g_3nmDlLyID7hQ1g.jpeg\"><figcaption>I make the margin-top of my content to\u00a064</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*UWDGtaaQ9V2Yb00NhDmghA.jpeg\"><figcaption>I also make the top margin of the form content to the greeting content into 96. Which is also a multiple of\u00a08</figcaption></figure><p>Now let's say you have explored the tools and make your sketch into a wireframe. You can look at mine below, as you can see the wireframe is look-alike the sketch. And you should make yours look the same as your sketch\u00a0too.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ERKuSpXrsWtxWJ36XLqKTA.jpeg\"><figcaption>I\u2019ve made a textbox, button, and a little link to sign\u00a0up</figcaption></figure><p>That\u2019s it. You\u2019ve made a wireframe! Now let\u2019s move to the next step. It\u2019s time to finalize the design by putting color on other\u00a0stuff.</p>\n<h3>UI Design</h3>\n<h4>Color</h4>\n<p>Okay, so this is the interesting part and my favorite part of designing an interface. Putting color on all the components! \ud83c\udf89 If you want to achieve a clean design, you have to choose a soft or pastel color. You can find a lot of color palettes on the internet, or you can make it by\u00a0yourself</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/563/1*zFjnOPUnQosSMEOBW-_amg.jpeg\"><figcaption>Color palette I found on <a href=\"http://pinterest.com/\">Pinterest</a></figcaption></figure><p>But this is why I love using Figma, Figma really make our work a lot easier. We can install a lot of cool plugins on it. Such as color palette. Yes, they have color palettes plugin that makes our workflow so much easier and faster obviously. If you go back to your dashboard or drafts when all your files are stored, on the left panel you can see plugins. So if you want to install a plugin you can just click it and find a plugin that you want then press the install\u00a0button.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*gts7lvI-QJGlu3oVIx-ybw.jpeg\"><figcaption>This is the color palettes plugin that I installed on my\u00a0Figma</figcaption></figure><p>So how you used this plugin? Simple. Just go to your file where you make the wireframe earlier. And in the top corner left there\u2019s a menu that you can click. When you click it there\u2019s an option for plugins, and there\u2019s where your plugins\u00a0stored.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/594/1*rx8Rt4AREH7tn-X7ON7eRQ.jpeg\"><figcaption>There are several plugins that I\u2019ve installed</figcaption></figure><p>Using the color palettes plugin is just by clicking the plugin and a new window will open up. There\u2019s a lot of color plugin you can use, just click the color and you\u2019ve automatically copied the hex code of the\u00a0color.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*7tCthV4vLz0p7R6L__0hng.jpeg\"></figure><p>So let\u2019s say you\u2019ve chosen the color. Now click the component where you want to put a color on it. And look at the right side of the panel, there\u2019s an option called \u201cfill\u201d. Now click the fill and paste the hex code that you\u2019ve copied\u00a0earlier.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*v07vOW9TR6VvjscaSv2ucQ.jpeg\"></figure><p>In this design I want my greeting text to have two colors, the app name should have a different color to make a variation and to bold the app name. So how to do it? Just block the text that you want to change the color and same as before, click the fill and paste the hex code of the new\u00a0color.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*sUE92JCv4P3Wi6km0vpD9A.jpeg\"></figure><p>And I only put two color tones on this design just to make it more simple. It\u2019s dark green and light green. If you\u2019re curious the hex code is #59B791 for the dark green and #ABE4CD for the light green. For the form text and the button text, I also used different colors. I used light grey as my form text, the hex code is #8C8B98. And the button text is just white\u00a0color.</p>\n<blockquote><strong>Little tips</strong></blockquote>\n<blockquote>Use a darker color for the link than the other text, so the user will know that there\u2019s a link that can be click/pressed. Now it should look like\u00a0this.</blockquote>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Z0-hOY06nzaTi3pS04-RJQ.jpeg\"></figure><h4>Icon</h4>\n<p>It almost there! \ud83c\udf89 So, what do you think needs to be added? Right! there\u2019s two rectangle shapes besides the form text that we still don\u2019t know what to do with it. And now what do you think should we put there? Yup, some\u00a0icons!</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*nQLScynHWWqGev08\"><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@aquatium?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Harpal Singh</a> on\u00a0<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>There\u2019s a lot of ways to make an icon, you can make it by yourself and save it as svg format then put it to your frame or download it on the internet then put it to your frame again. We all agree it\u2019s kind of complicated right? But don\u2019t worry, as I said before Figma really makes our work a lot easier. We can use plugin again for the icon. There are a lot of icon plugins on Figma, but I installed the one called\u00a0Iconify.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*eJ1x1PU_VSYRMXpKR6i44Q.jpeg\"></figure><p>Now I\u2019ll show you how to use this plugin. Basically it\u2019s the same as the previous plugin. Just go to the place where your color palettes plugin stored. If you already installed iconify plugin, there will be shown on the option. And just click\u00a0it.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*WgWHfiESzSJQevv7uSDHWA.jpeg\"><figcaption>This is how the plugin looks\u00a0like</figcaption></figure><p>Now you can find any icon that you want. And if you want to make your design clean and simple, make sure you use the same icon style. Just take a look at the icons that I\u2019ve\u00a0picked.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*pFPGiwonA9cQNaW3rILfMg.jpeg\"><figcaption>I\u2019m using line style for all\u00a0icon</figcaption></figure><h4>Finishing</h4>\n<p>After all the layout is done, we need some improvements. As you can see the design is a little bit boring. So we have to add something. In this part you can use your imagination to make the design \u201cless quiet\u201d. So I\u2019ll try to make something with the shape\u00a0tool.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m trying to make geometric shapes by using the circle tool. So all you have to do is making a small circle around 5px. Then copy-pasted it until you think it\u2019s enough, and I\u2019m making it 9x9. And then use the same color as the form text, and group all the circle by pressing ctrl+g or command+g if you\u2019re using\u00a0macOS.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*75ElD2yCMXg2ceYn7jRwow.jpeg\"></figure><p>Now I want to make a curved line with the pen tool then copy-pasted it to make an abstract shape. You can find the pen tool the same as the other tool, it is right beside the shape tool. And to use it all you have to do is just click and hold until it\u00a0bent.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*s9_Y4kShgOpvkyevGc5kEA.jpeg\"></figure><p>Then change the stroke color the same as the form text color. You can change the stroke color in the right-side panel, it\u2019s in the same place as the fill option. And group all the line then put it wherever you think it fits. I put mine on the top left of the\u00a0frame.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*hVi4Z9gadAIUxASxaRi2TQ.jpeg\"><figcaption>Those are the shapes that we just\u00a0made</figcaption></figure><p>And now it\u2019s done!\u00a0\ud83c\udf89</p>\n<p>You can also explore it to make the Sign-Up section design. I hope this tutorial helps you to improve your design skill and I hope it motivated you to design gorgeous\u00a0UI/UX.</p>\n<blockquote>Happy designing and stay\u00a0curious!</blockquote>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*gx--cCqbRb0aaAImeDBHeA.jpeg\"></figure><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=cababa2ddaab\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.prototypr.io/how-i-make-a-clean-ui-design-for-login-section-with-figma-from-scratch-cababa2ddaab\">How I make a clean UI design for login section with Figma from scratch</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://blog.prototypr.io/\">Prototypr</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>\n","enclosure":{},"categories":["ui","mobile","design","figma","ux"]}]}
